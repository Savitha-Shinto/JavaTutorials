//Instance Variables
//        Instance variables are declared in a class, but outside a method, constructor or any block.
//        Instance variables are created when an object is created with the use of the keyword 'new'
//        and destroyed when the object is destroyed.
//        Instance variables can be declared in class level before or after use.
//        Access modifiers can be given for instance variables.
//        The instance variables are visible for all methods, constructors and block in the class.
//        Normally, it is recommended to make these variables private (access level). However,
//        visibility for subclasses can be given for these variables with the use of access modifiers.
//        Instance variables have default values. For numbers, the default value is 0,
//        for Booleans it is false, and for object references it is null.
//        Values can be assigned during the declaration or within the constructor.
//        Instance variables can be accessed directly by calling the variable name inside the class.
//        However, within static methods (when instance variables are given accessibility),
//        they should be called using the fully qualified name.Â ObjectReference.VariableName.
