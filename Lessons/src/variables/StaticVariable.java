//Class/Static Variables
//        Class variables also known as static variables are declared with the static keyword in a class,
//        but outside a method, constructor or a block.
//        There would only be one copy of each class variable per class, regardless of how many objects are created from it.
//        Static variables are rarely used other than being declared as constants. Constants are variables
//        that are declared as public/private, final, and static. Constant variables never change from their initial value.
//        Static variables are created when the program starts and destroyed when the program stops.
//        Static variables can be accessed by calling with the class nameÂ ClassName.VariableName.
